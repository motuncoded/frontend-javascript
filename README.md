- Use the provided `webpack.config.js` for bundling the application.
- Ensure that the TypeScript code is transpiled to JavaScript and bundled correctly.



## Instructions

1. Create a new TypeScript file named `main.ts` in the `js` folder of `task_0` folder.
2. Implement the `Student` interface and create the student objects.
3. Create a function to render the student information in a table format.
4. Use Vanilla JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and display the table.
5. Ensure that the TypeScript code is transpiled to JavaScript using the provided `tsconfig.json`.
6. Bundle the application using Webpack with the provided `webpack.config.js`.
7. Test the application in a web browser to ensure that the student information is displayed correctly.
